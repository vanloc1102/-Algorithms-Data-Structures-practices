//Example 1:
//
//Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
//Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
//Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
//It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
//Example 2:
//
//Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
//Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
//Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
//Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
//It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
